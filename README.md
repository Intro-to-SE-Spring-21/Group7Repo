Project Description:
* The goal of this project is to make a Twitter-like clone with features such as tweeting, liking tweets, following users, and some extra features. With that being said, we plan to use a variety of resources to make this project perform as best as possible for the user. We will begin with a user-friendly UI/UX design and implement this design with Html5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and Javascript. These languages seem to be industry standard and/or easy to use, so it will allow our team to make this project with ease while expanding our programming library. Additionally, we plan to use Sqlite to be our database management system because it does not require a dedicated server while still storing all the users' data. We hope this project will help each of our members grow as a software engineering student and create a better understanding of the webpage application development process and the aspects that come with it. This includes arguably the most important part of the software development process: the engineering process. The engineering process our team will be using is the agile method and more specifically the scrum technique. This will allow us to get real-world practice with a great engineering process and prominent technique of this process. We also plan to acquire a better understanding of each coding language we plan to use and how these languages intertwine with each other. Furthermore, our team plans to develop a better understanding of Github and its in's and out's because it is an established website where professionals can commute with other programmers without having to meet in person. Github is used by some of the biggest tech companies like Google and Amazon, and it would be very beneficial for us to learn. Additionally, our team will not be able to meet in person during lab hours because of the ongoing pandemic. Our team is excited about this project and are ready for any challenge that comes our way.

Coding languges to be used:
* front-end: html/css/javascript
* back-end: sqlite
* rest of the languages TBD
